# EvalTo

EvalTo implements a toolchain for running cost estimation problems (see _About_).

## Prerequisites
To effectively be executed on a `bash` shell, EvalTo requires such shell to support the following commands:
* `python` (version 3.4 or higher),
* `pip`, and
* `swipl`.

The available installation of Python must also be equipped with the following Python packages:
* `pyswip` and 
* `tosca-parser`.

Both above packages can be easily installed by typing `sudo pip install <packageName>`.

## Using EvalTo

### Defining a cost estimation problem 

To define a cost estimation problem, three artifacts have to be developed:
1. A TOSCA specification of the _topology of the application_ on which the problem is to be defined,
2. A Python module defining the _compositors_ to be used to combine the costs associated with the components forming the application, and
3. A Python module associating the components forming the application with their _costs_.

Templates for 2 and 3 are available in the [data/templates](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/eval-to/tree/master/data/templates) subfolder. Complete examples of cost estimation problems are instead available in the [data/examples](https://github.com/di-unipi-socc/eval-to/tree/master/data/examples) subfolder.

### Running EvalTo
EvalTo is designed to run on `bash` shells. To run a cost estimation problem (defined as illustrated above), just type the following command
```
python evalto.py <toscaFile> <compositorsFile.py> <costsFile.py>
```
when positioned in the main folder of the current repository. Note: 
* `<toscaFile>` is the relative/absolute path to the YAML file specifying the application topology in TOSCA,
* `<compositorsFile.py>` is the relative/absolute path to the Python module defining the cost compositors, while
* `<costsFile.py>` is the relative/absolute path to the Python module associating the components forming the application with their costs.
